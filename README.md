# RAC-Light-Grid-Architecture
Node based individual processing sets interconnected for parallel like travel
# RAC Light Grid Architecture 🧠💡

This project showcases a novel architecture for light-based processing using RACs (Recognition & Activation Cores). It demonstrates 3D traversal of memory nodes without relying on a central processor.

## 🚀 Highlights

- True **3D grid of RAC nodes** (visualized)
- Manual & diagonal traversal of a signal across a memory grid
- Proof of concept for **parallel, non-linear data flow**
- Visual demos as animated GIFs

## 📸 Visual Demo
